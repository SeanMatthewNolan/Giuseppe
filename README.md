# Giuseppe: Indirect OCP Solver

The goal of Giuseppe is to a general-purpose optimal control problem (OCP) solver which leverages indirect methods to produce high quality solutions.
It also aims to be a platform for future research into the use of indirect methods for solving OCPs.

Giuseppe is still a very new project and a work in progress.
If you are interested in using it in the future, please check back for more features and documentation very soon.

The project is named for St. Joseph of Cupertino (San **Giuseppe** da Copertino) the patron of students and aviation.
I invite any interested to read of his extraordinary life.

## Installation

The easiest way to install Giuseppe is by cloning or downloading this repository and running
```
pip install -e <installation_directory>
```
Currently, the project only supports Python 3.10, but it should soon support back until 3.8.
Also, I hope to soon add the project to PyPA once it is a little more mature.
